# Contributing

First, thank you for contributing!

When submitting new WICs, please submit a `yml` sourcefile (`yml/`) as these are used to generate everything else. Next, review `README.md` and ensure the WIC has a functionality that would be useful to an attacker.

There is a template that can be used located here if you do not want to copy one of the existing WICs: https://github.com/hegusung/WIC/blob/master/YML-Template.yml   
It is also important to use these (https://github.com/hegusung/WIC/blob/master/CategoryList.md) categories, since they relate to the web portal and it is crucial to get them right for everything to work.

Looking forward for your contributions.
