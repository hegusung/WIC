# Windows Infection Components (WIC)

<img src="https://github.com/hegusung/wic-project.github.io/raw/master/assets/logo.png" height="250">

All the different files can be found behind a fancy frontend here: https://hegusung.github.io/wic-project.github.io/# (thanks @ConsciousHacker for this bit of eyecandy and the team over at https://gtfobins.github.io/).
This repo serves as a place where we maintain the YML files that are used by the fancy frontend.

## Goal

The goal of the WIC project is to document every binary, script, COM and Windows API that can be used for Windows Infection.

## Criteria

A LOLBin/Lib/Script must:

* Be a Windows functionality which can be used for initial infection.
* Have functionality that would be useful to an APT or red team

Interesting functionality can include:

* Executing code
* Executing scripts
* Can be executed by simply clicking it
* Create or modify registry keys
